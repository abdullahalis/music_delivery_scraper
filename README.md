# Automated Music Delivery System

I developed a Python program to streamline music distribution by automating client outreach. I leveraged a Twitter scraping utility to gather email addresses of potential clients in the music production space, analyzing tweet content to identify users actively seeking production services.

I then used an email messaging API to automatically create and send emails attaching the beats and my contact information. This system significantly boosted outreach, resulting in over five times the average number of emails distributed compared to manual methods.
